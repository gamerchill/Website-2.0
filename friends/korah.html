            <p>Wait, huh? Korah? Who? Oh. You seriously don't know who this girl is? wait fr? Nah you're joking, right? Dawg, I thought you knew she was one of THE goats. How do you still not know? This kinda wild bro. Aight, well I gotta give a run-down, huh? </p>
            <p>Korah overall is a really great girl. Probably like one of the top few, amongst the others like Jaz, Delta, and Em.  Yea so some of the contending things of her are comprised of 5 primary traits. She's crazy, responsible (I think), hard-working, trustworthy, and did I say that she's a real one?</p>
            <p> What makes her crazy is her being herself. Not something you see these days. She's just naturally crazy. That's not a bad thing too. She's able to balance the means of meeting new people and experiencing new things. Isn't afraid to take what it means to be 'Korah'.</p>

I could cut this short and say she's a hard-worker. But that is pretty boring icl. When I say she's a hard-worker, she probably is. A mod in the Fire Nation, but also has work that consists of sorting videos and clips, while also indulging into the editing of such clips AND possibly dabbling into videography is no easy task. Aight, I think we done with everything! Wait no, mb. We have 2 more traits to talk about. the second to last one is trustworthiness. She truely is trustworthy. If she is mod in most discord communities that I personally am in, then she probably is trusted. She could also gain trust in many members in said communities which is pretty hard to do (it isn't, I lied).</p></div></a>

                <h4>Maybe a real one</h4>
                <p>Last but not least... she's a real one. How? well, its pretty much the same reason with everyone else. They're NOT a fraud (however, Korah sometimes is). She too is a fed but does it look like I give 2 thoughts bout it? NO!!!!1 (yes, I do actually).</p>

                <p>Okayyyy. That probably is too much reading. In short,
                    Korah is like one of the cool people, on par with many others. However, she's not as cool as me (when I say me, I meant me, the only developer, Chillmaster) (The sad part is that she actually is cooler than me).</p>

                <h4>Well, why this design of a subpage?</h4>
                <p>I generally just have a few designs at the top of my mind. However, this design is heavily inspired. <em>very.. inspired</em>. Yea so anyways, I knew that Kara edits and probably films videos. It kind of gave me some
                idea of what I should make her page be. Making a subpage with something that matches who she is is crazy fr.</p>

We (as in we, I mean like a ton of people, like Fred and me, Chill) always invade her VC to chat and stuff for funsies</p></a>

I absolutely need this portion to fit the aesthetic. With barely any yap, and the coolness factor goes down like several folds. </p>
