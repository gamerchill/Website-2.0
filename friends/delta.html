                    <p class="subline">She's a true princess, both on the inside and digitally. </p>
                    <p>Made for <strong>Delta/Faye</strong> &#8212;<strong>developed</strong> by Chill <strong>6/17/24</strong></p>

                    <h1>Ok, soooo who is she?</h1>
        <p> Delta is a girl who is well known within many communites, such as the Fire Nation.
            She've developed bots in the past, and moderated many communities to maintain order. She is also defined by 5 things everyone can almost agree on:
            <br> &#8212; She's wholesome
            <br> &#8212; She's chill
            <br> &#8212; She's authentic
            <br> &#8212; She's elite
            <br> &#8212; She's a real one
        <p>
            <h4>
            Okay, let me explain -
            </h4>
            <h5> Wholesome: </h5>
            <p>
    Delta is really wholesome. She doesn't know it, but she really is. She's nearly positive all the time (from my standpoint) and pretty much accepts
    who she really is. Something no one really pays attention to. She (probably) acts wholesome and she speaks wholesome. She IS the definition of wholesome.
            </p>
            <h5> Chill:</h5>
            <p>
            Pretty ironic as I (chillmaster) am creating this, but Delta really is chill. Arguably more chill than me. Here is why - 
            She's incredibly easy to get along with, and laid back. 
            </p>
            <h5> Authetic: </h5>
            <p>
            Probably one of the few who's truely the most real to themselves and others. I personally haven't seen her
            fake herself much. Always being who she is, without explicitly showing. There is also one thing she never fakes.
            The friend request. (I'm still awaiting the acceptance of my friend request).
            </p>
            <h5>
                Elite:
            </h5>
                <p>
                A member of the Elite. An OG. She is popular for (mainly) the right reasons.
                (nearly) every Elite member is someone I automatically someone I respect.
                </p>
            <h5>
                Finally: A real one:
            </h5>
            <p>
                Delta is a real one for multiple reasons. Aside from the 5 traits on why, She's someone anyone can rely on.
                Either though a simple 5 minute vc, or a simple check if anyone is a fraud (She's almost never one). She's amongst the few
                where someone can easily trust. 
            </p>

            <p>
                tldr;
                I respect her. She's really great, and someone I'm willing to learn more about.
