                <p>
                  The one guy who created videos with this Preston person or whoever (yea, he made videos with this Pr*ston guy and he prolly isn't even popular. Aidan giving him a shoutout will prolly give this Pr*ston dude some needed attention)

                <h1>Who's he?</h1>
                <div class="all-about">
                    <p>Aight. so I personally don't know Aidan that much. This 'about me' is going to be incrediby short but we'll do what we can do.
                      <br><br> Okay. So Aidan.. Who the *** is he? Well, He is a wonderful dude actually. Despite him filming videos with this preston dude, 
                      he overall is humble, genuine, and pretty outgoing. How, you may ask? well - <br>
                      He is pretty humble to say the least. He personally does not go out in the world and say "L Bozo guys, I filmed a video with a guy with 1 subscriber, im so much better than all of you peasants".
                      In fact, he mostly just stays low-key bout it, which is really cool to know.
                      <br> Then there's the genuinity portion of Aidan. He indeed is real. Not faking anything. As real as an Aidan can be. Well, he could be faking himself, but I doubt it. 
                      He forged his own paths to be who he really is, while also advising others on what or what not to do.
                      <br>Finally, the outgoing aspect of who he is. I personally say he's one of the most outgoing individuals I've stumbled across. Easy to spark a conversation with This
                      fine fellow individual. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Aidan is also a legend within the community. Known by a niche portion of the community and the real ones.
                      Getting to know this guy is a really great opportunity for me, and he serves as one of the people I look up to for certain situations.
                      This guy is someone I trust with some things, and not with others. <br><br> Okay, thats great and all, but what what's the summary?
                      <br><br><br>okokok, relax. Who Aidan really is can't be contained within 1 sentence. He's someone to respect, as well to befriend. There's no one more 
                      awesome than who engraved their name within the YouTube space than Aidan.
