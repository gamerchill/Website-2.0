        <div class="centered">
            <h1>So, he is Fire Nation's favorite pineapple... By far.</h1>

            <p>No, really. He IS the pineapple. He can entertain and occupy you in vc for hours on end. However, his ways are kind of annoying. 
				Besides him annoying you e v e r y   s i n g l e  minute, theres no doubt that he is a real one. He's not a fed, nor a fraud. He's just a young pineapple
				trying to form (and breaking) the trust with everyone he meets. Lil bro is also quite authentic. Quite honest with who he is.. most times. 
				His sleep schedule is all messed up, and non existent. He VCs with everyone during night (at his time). Is it worth VCing every night just to say "how you doing ___"and play skyrim, valorant, and 
				lethal company? To him, yes. What's also great about him is the nostalgia he holds with the other OG members as he was a wee youngerster. 
				He cooks everyone he knows or doesn't know, trying to spread hate within. It's all fine though as long as he is an Elite, and most importantly, a Real one.

            <p>Okay so basically I trashed talked Fred the whole time. He's great and all but his sleep schedule is Something
				way out of the ordinary.
