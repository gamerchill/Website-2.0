            <p>Stoney. <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;What a guy he is. A true legend. Brought everyone together, for fun. "no big deal, guys" - Stoney probably. </p>
            <p>Stoney is that type of guy that everyone absolutely loves (platonically). He engraved his legacy to everyone, without knowing. He's a True one. 
              Okay, Here's a little quiz for you. Is he -  <br>A) Trustworthy<br>B) Cordial<br> C) Affable<br>D)Genuine </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-sm-6">
            <p>If you said A, B, C, or D, then you're wrong! It's actually every option I gave out. Why you may ask? <br>
            Well-
            <br> This man is just trustworthy. I don't know how you explain it, but he's just trustworthy. You just feel like you trust him. That's all there is to it. No real
            explanation. <br> He's also just cordial. Everytime in chat, he's so outgoing, and the chat is so warm and inviting. Stoney is that one guy you're eager to
            become friends with, either on a friends list or relationally. Both workss just fine.<br> He's quite Affable, very similar to being cordial, but this word works wonders with
            how polite he is. Super friendly. Super easy to approach and have a good time with. Just like those VC sessions with everyone, like just a simple
            roblox game night with Jaz, me (Chill), and Spiff, or that one time making the iceberg. All great times.
          <br>Finally, he's Genuine. As genuine as can be. Not a fraud, but a real one. The GOAT. Never once was a fraud, and probably will never be a fraud but he will always be a word of God.
            </p>
          <p>tl;dr -<br> Stoney is actually way more chill than me, surprisingly. Actually one of the coolest guys I've ever met. </p>
