                        Wait, huh? Korah? Who? Oh. You seriously don't know who this girl is? wait fr? Nah you're joking, right? Dawg, I thought you knew she was one of THE goats. How do you still not know? This kinda wild bro. Aight, well I gotta give a run-down, huh?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Korah overall is a really great girl. Probably like one of the top few, amongst the others like Jaz, Delta, and Em.

                        Yea so some of the contending things of her are comprised of 5 primary traits. She's crazy, responsible (I think), hard-working, trustworthy, and did I say that she's a real one?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What makes her crazy is her being herself. Not something you see these days. She's just naturally crazy. That's not a bad thing too. She's able to balance the means of meeting new people and experiencing new things. Isn't afraid to take what it means to be 'Korah'.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Okay, maybe that was a bit overboard. I could cut this short and say she's a hard-worker. But that is pretty boring icl. When I say she's a hard-worker, she probably is. A mod in the Fire Nation, but also has work that consists of sorting videos and clips, while also indulging into the editing of such clips AND possibly dabbling into videography is no easy task.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She too is responsible (if she isn't then erm... pretend this little article doesn't exist!!!1) How cool is that? Okay, maybe not thaaaat cool. Still awesome regardless. She follows through on her commitments, and owns up to her mistakes. She probably almost always meets deadlines.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="column">
                    <div class="outside"></div>
                    <p>
                        Aight, I think we done with everything! Wait no, mb. We have 2 more traits to talk about. the second to last one is trustworthiness. She truely is trustworthy. If she is mod in most discord communities that I personally am in, then she probably is trusted. She could also gain trust in many members in said communities which is pretty hard to do (it isn't, I lied).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Last but not least... she's a real one. How? well, its pretty much the same reason with everyone else. They're NOT a fraud (however, Korah sometimes is). She too is a fed but does it look like I give 2 thoughts bout it? NO!!!!1 (yes, I do actually).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Okayyyy. That probably is too much for alot of you people. tl;dr:
                        Korah is like one of the cool people, on par with many others. However, she's not as cool as me (when I say me, I meant me, the only developer, Chillmaster) (The sad part is that she actually is cooler than me).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Also, surpisingly, we (as in Kara and Chill) have a little list of what we agree upon. She says im not an agreeable person but I quite literally am. So the list of things we agree on is made. If imma be honest, I forgot what the few things we agreed upon. Ask her for what it is, not me! <br> <b>Source: trust me bro</b>

                    <p>
                        Bro, I seriously have to yap more on this little portion, and then IM DONE (with Korah's subpage ofc). I hope she doesn't mind this portion though. I absolutely need this portion to fit the aesthetic. With barely any yap, and the coolness factor goes down like several folds. Anyways, I chose this design because it matches the vibe of her. She's like in some form of content creation/documentary or something cause she edits and videos stuff. This design gives like a newspaper type of vibe, and it kinda fits her style in some way icl.
